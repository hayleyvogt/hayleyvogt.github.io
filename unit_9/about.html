			<p id="right">I grew up with a passion for building things and problem solving which has carried over into my adult life. I went to college for Structural Engineering attending Iowa State University for undergrad and Northwestern for grad school. During grad school, I became extremely interested in technology and software and started learning everything I could about software development. After reading almost every book at Barnes and Noble on the subject, I moved to San Francisco to attend Hack Reactor - a coding bootcamp for software engineering. The experiences I have had while living in four major US Cities and one city in the UK has really helped to shape who I am today â€“ a down-to-earth, structurally sound, energetic, tech nerd from the Midwest.</p>
